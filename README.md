# Legal Chatbot ⚖️
### Homework #2 for NLP course Spring 02-03 at Sharif University - [Dr Ehsaneddin Asgari](https://github.com/ehsanasgari)

Legal chatbot is a handy assistant which can be started on [matrix](https://matrix.org). It is able to extract legal features from the input text and find similar law cases. 

* Most of the times law cases are too large and becasue of the character limitation on matrix, we can not send the whole case in a message. Because of that we will write cases in a file named `cases.txt`.

#### Bot Commands:

1. The first command is `راهنما`. By entering this command you will recieve a guidance in persian about the bot usage.
2. If you enter anything but `راهنما‍`, It will be considered as legal text and it will be processed.

#### Installation:

2. Install the requirements by `pip install -r Requirements.txt`.
3. Run the project by `sh start.sh`. 🚀
